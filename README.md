This is a script written in PHP to grab video URLs from Youtube API using browse_ajax file.

This script is capable of fetching videos with maximum resolution of 720p. 
The 480p quality is excluded because the video and audio files are separate.

This can also download videos from channels and playlist links even if the load more option is present 
i.e. by making multiple ajax request calls to the new urls.

Happy Coding!
